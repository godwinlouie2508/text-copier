# LinkedIn Post - Text Copier

## Detailed Version

🎉 **Excited to announce the release of Text Copier – A Modern Windows Desktop Productivity Tool!**

After weeks of development, I'm thrilled to share my latest open-source project designed to solve a common problem: managing frequently used text snippets efficiently.

**💡 The Problem:**
As a developer/content creator, I often found myself constantly copying and pasting the same text snippets – API keys, code templates, email signatures, boilerplate responses. Switching between files or note apps was slowing me down.

**✨ The Solution:**
Text Copier is a lightweight, privacy-first Windows desktop application that keeps your frequently used text at your fingertips.

**🚀 Key Features:**

📋 **Smart Organization** – Manage items across 5 customizable tabs that you can rename and categorize however you like

🎨 **Chrome-Style Tab Management** – Drag and drop tabs to reorder them, just like your browser. Smooth, intuitive, and familiar.

🔒 **Security-First** – Password-style hidden fields for sensitive information like API keys, tokens, or credentials. Your data never leaves your machine.

📥 **Backup & Restore** – Export all your data to CSV for safe backups, or import from existing files. Never lose your snippets again.

🎯 **Bulk Operations** – Select multiple items and delete them at once. Efficient management for power users.

📝 **One-Click Copy** – Copy item names or text content with a single click. No more selecting, right-clicking, and copying.

🌓 **Beautiful Themes** – Built-in dark and light modes that adapt to your preference. Professional, clean interface with smooth animations.

💾 **Auto-Save** – Everything saves automatically to local storage. No cloud sync, no tracking, complete privacy.

⚡ **Blazing Fast** – Instant startup, minimal memory footprint (~50MB), and smooth performance.

**🛠️ Technical Highlights:**

Built this with modern technologies that prioritize performance and security:

🦀 **Tauri Framework** – Leveraging Rust for the backend provides memory safety, blazing speed, and a tiny installer size (~2MB vs traditional Electron apps at 100MB+)

⚛️ **React** – Component-based UI for smooth interactions and maintainable code

🎨 **Modern CSS** – Custom-built UI with gradient animations, glassmorphism effects, and responsive design

🔧 **GitHub Actions** – Automated builds for continuous integration

**📊 Why This Tech Stack?**

Choosing Tauri over Electron was a deliberate decision:
• 95% smaller installer size
• 50% less memory usage at runtime
• Better security through Rust's memory safety
• Native performance while using web technologies

**🪟 Windows Platform:**
Available now for Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

**📖 Open Source & Free:**
Released under MIT License – free to use, modify, and contribute!

**🙏 What's Next?**
I'm looking for feedback from the community! If you try it out, I'd love to hear:
• What features would make it even more useful?
• Any bugs or issues you encounter?
• Ideas for future enhancements?

Feel free to open issues, submit PRs, or just star the repo if you find it useful! Every bit of feedback helps make this tool better for everyone.

**💬 Who is this for?**
• Developers managing API keys, code snippets, and commands
• Content creators with template responses and boilerplate text
• Customer support teams with frequent response templates
• Anyone who copies and pastes the same text repeatedly

Building in public has been an incredible learning experience. From designing the UX to debugging cross-platform builds, every challenge taught me something new about desktop app development.

Would love to connect with others working on open-source productivity tools or anyone interested in Tauri/Rust development!
